# generator-electrode [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> Generate Electrode ~~Isomorphic~~ Universal React App with NodeJS backend.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman], [gulp], and generator-electrode using [npm] (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js] (> 4.2.x required)).

```bash
$ npm install -g yo gulp generator-electrode
```

> Note: You may need add `sudo` to the command.

Then generate your new project:

```bash
$ mkdir your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ yo electrode
```

## Running the app

Once the application is generated and `npm install` is completed, you are ready to try it out.

```bash
$ npm start
```

Wait for webpack to be ready and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` with your browser.

You can run [gulp] to see the list of tasks available.

Some common ones:

  - `gulp dev` - start in webpack-dev-server development mode
  - `gulp hot` - start in webpack-dev-server hot mode
  - `gulp build` - build production `dist` files
  - `gulp server-prod` - start server in production mode
  - `gulp check` - run unit tests with coverage
